## Introduction

This Fraud Detection system uses a combination of features, including `distance_from_home`, `distance_from_last_transaction`, `ratio_to_median_purchase_price`, `repeat_retailer`, `used_chip`, `used_pin_number`, and `online_order`, to identify patterns indicative of credit card fraud. The goal is to provide a reliable and automated solution for detecting potentially fraudulent transactions.

## Features

- Analyzes various transaction features to determine the likelihood of fraud.
- Customizable parameters for fine-tuning detection accuracy.

## Usage

To use the Fraud Detection bot in your project, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies.
2. Import the necessary modules and files.
3. Use the provided functions to analyze credit card transactions and detect fraud.

Example code:

```javascript
// Import necessary modules
const Matrix = require('./Matrix.js');
const actFUNC = require('./actFUNC.js');
const canvas = require('./canvas.js');
const card = require('./card.js');
const ekko = require('./ekko.js');
const saveNet = require('./saveNet.js');

// Use the modules to implement fraud detection logic
// ...

// Save the trained neural network
saveNet.save(neuralNetwork, 'trained-net.json');
```

## Files

The repository includes the following files:

- **Matrix.js**: Contains matrix math operations for data manipulation.
